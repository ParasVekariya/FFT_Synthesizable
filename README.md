# FFT_Synthesizable

This repository contains the code for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which was achieved using Radix-2 Butterfly structure. 
It has mainly three files:
- FFT.c
- FFT.h
- test_FFT.c
And they were devided such so as to fulfill the requirements of Vitis HLS which was used to check if this code synthesizes in to verilog. We require the main code file , one fle which is testbench for the file and contains the **main** function which calls the code function. And last is the header file which contains function definations.
Codes are pretty self explanatory and for convinience, comments are also added in the code wherever required.
